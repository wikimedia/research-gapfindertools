Translate section titles to train our robots
Translate these section titles as you would expect to find them on Wikipedia articles in your language. If, depending on context, a section title can have multiple translations in your Wikipedia language, provide all translations. Use suggestions by auto-complete feature or write your own translation. If you don't know a translation or a translation doesn't exist, skip. The more you translate the better suggestions we'll be able to provide to editors in the future.
